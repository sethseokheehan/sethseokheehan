I’m Seth Han, an undergraduate in Dartmouth’s Class of 2029 studying engineering sciences and music (GPA 4.0/4.0). My research focuses on machine learning for cyber-resilient energy systems and topology-aware weakly supervised semantic segmentation for anomaly detection. I currently work with the CREATE Lab at Dartmouth.

Before Dartmouth, I co-founded Drice and led the development of an AI-powered drone system for real-time black ice detection, resulting in a peer-reviewed paper and a granted Korean patent. My work has been recognized through the Presidential Science Scholarship of South Korea, multiple national science awards, and a Regeneron ISEF final.

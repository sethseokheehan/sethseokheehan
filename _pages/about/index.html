I’m a freshman at Dartmouth pursuing engineering sciences and music, thanks to the support by the Presidential Science Scholarship of South Korea.</p> <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of applied machine learning and computer vision, and I’m currently working on robust machine learning for virtual power plants under cyber attacks under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cpeslab/junbo-zhao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Junbo Zhao</a> and developing topology-aware weakly-supervised semantic segmentation for manufacturing anomaly detection.</p> <p>Before Dartmouth, I co-founded Drice and led the development of an AI-powered drone system for real-time black ice detection. I also worked for Enuma, an edtech startup developing AI-driven learning solutions for children with special needs.</p> <p>In my free time, I cook, play drums, and make films.</p> </body></html>
